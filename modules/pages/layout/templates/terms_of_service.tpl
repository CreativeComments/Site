						<p>These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Belgium without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Should the arbitration provision above be found unenforceable for any reason, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Service will be courts located in Ghent, Belgium and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
